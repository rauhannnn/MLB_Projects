# MLB_Projects

Welcome to the **MLB_Projects** repository! This repo contains all the AI and machine learning projects I've completed during the **Machine Learning Bootcamp** with the **Nittany AI Club** at **Penn State** (Fall 2024). Each project showcases a variety of machine learning models and techniques, ranging from simple classifiers to neural networks, all trained on real-world datasets.

## Projects Overview

Hereâ€™s a detailed summary of the projects included in this repository:

### 1. Predicting Flower Types
- **Description**: This project involved building a model to predict different types of flowers based on several features in the dataset. The task was solved using a **logistic regression model** from the **scikit-learn** library.
- **Tools**: scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
- **Dataset**: Sourced from **Kaggle**, containing multiple features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width to classify flower types.
- **Key Learning**: Explored feature selection, data preprocessing, and the power of logistic regression for classification tasks. Achieved solid accuracy on the dataset with a straightforward yet effective approach.

### 2. Fashion MNIST Classification
- **Description**: This project tackled the **Fashion MNIST** classification problem, where the goal was to classify different types of clothing items. I designed and built a **neural network from scratch** using **PyTorch** and trained it on a modified version of the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model learned to distinguish between categories like shirts, dresses, and sneakers based on image data.
- **Tools**: PyTorch for building and training the neural network.
- **Dataset**: Modified **Fashion MNIST dataset** containing 28x28 grayscale images of various clothing types.
- **Key Learning**: This project deepened my understanding of neural networks, backpropagation, and the importance of tuning hyperparameters like learning rates and epochs for optimal performance. Additionally, I explored image preprocessing and augmentation to improve model accuracy.

## Tools & Libraries

Throughout these projects, I've worked with the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: The core programming language for all projects.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for implementing traditional machine learning algorithms.
- **PyTorch**: Utilized for building and training neural networks from scratch.
- **Kaggle**: The source for datasets and data exploration.
